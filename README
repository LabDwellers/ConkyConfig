NAME
ConkyConfig - a git repository of the conky configs of three roommates

DESCRIPTION
ConkyConfig holds all the conky configs (experimental and current) of the three roommates who's only way of feeling better about themselves is having a more attractive Conky configuration.

In one corner there's Taki and his feeble attempts at wowing the public with lua scripts. Over in the other corner is Zanty with his text clock that he got from a forum (CrunchBang). Finally, there's williskevin and his attempt at making a folder called jesus and expecting automatic victory.

The rivalry sure is heating up. There have already been two cases of using up all the hot water from the shower out of pure conky envy.
