These scripts are eventually the plan to manage all of the conkyrc scripts
in an easy to use interface that doesn't involve mucking through those
scripts. It is also a way for me to explore making a front end to conky
configuration files and have it become able to adapt to different screen sizes.

-- CONTENTS --
./setup     - Script to setup the configurations and generate a start script
./uninstall - Script to uninstall the configurations and start script
./move.pl   - Script to move configurations on the screen different places
./screen.pl - Script to optimize various screen sizes
